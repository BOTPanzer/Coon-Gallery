# Coon Gallery
Gallery app for Android that uses a metadata file for searching images.

# Description
Coon Gallery is an Android gallery where you can select image albums and asign them metadata JSON files that contain descriptions for each of their images. 
These metadata files are used for searching images with context, for example images that contain a cat. Metadata files can be generated using the [Turbo Photos](https://github.com/BOTPanzer/Turbo-Photos) python app I also created.
