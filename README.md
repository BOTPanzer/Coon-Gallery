## How to Run

Download the last release from the [releases](https://github.com/BOTPanzer/Coon-Gallery/releases) page.

## How to Use

Excluding the normal gallery features, there are some new original things that Coon Gallery can do, these being **backing up your albums** to your PC and **enabling smart search** in the gallery. For these to work, you will need to setup *links* in the settings menu.

### Setup Links

*Links* are connections between an *album folder* and a *metadata file*.

- Adding an *album folder* will let you use the backup service to **backup your albums** from your phone to your computer.

- Adding an *album folder* and a *metadata file* will **improve the search** on those albums with the information inside the metadata file.

### Sync Albums & Metadata

To create **backups of your albums** and generate **metadata for their images**, you will need to connect to the [Coon Gallery](https://github.com/BOTPanzer/Coon-Gallery-PC) PC app.

1. **Find its address**
   
   To find its connection address, open it and navigate to the sync menu. There, you will find an *IP* and *PORT* in the logs, similar to *192.168.1.87:6969*. This is the address.

2. **Connect to the address**
   
   Once you have the address, open the sync service in your gallery, type it into the "Address" input and press "Connect". From here, everything is managed by your computer.
